= How To use google code and SVN =

First of all you must set up your eclipse o netbeans ide to build jme2!
follow this guides: http://jmonkeyengine.com/wiki/doku.php?id=downloading_and_installing_jme_2

Then you have to sync your IDE with our project svn.
For example in eclipse you have to:
  # add a new project
  # in the new project wizard expand SVN and select Checkout Projects from SVN
  # Create a new repository location
  # type in https://unical-3d-game.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
  # select the head and next two times
  # click finish

If it asks you a username and a password type in yours! 
Wait for the ceckout...

Now you can work on the project and do all the changes you want!

Everytime you start your eclipse, first sync with the svn: right click on the project and: project -> team -> update version

When you finished and you want to upload your changes just right click on your project and: project -> team -> commit

Have fun!!
