= How To use google code and SVN =

First of all you must set up your IDE to build jme2 and jme2physics! <br>
If your IDE is eclipse, follow this guide: http://code.google.com/p/unical-3d-game/wiki/jmeSetup<br>
Click here for other IDE's tutorials: http://jmonkeyengine.com/wiki/doku.php?id=downloading_and_installing_jme_2

Now you have to add a new SVN Ceckout Project from this URL: http://unical-3d-game.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

For example in eclipse (with subclipse) you have to:
  # add a new project
  # in the new project wizard expand SVN and select Checkout Projects from SVN
  # Create a new repository location
  # type in http://unical-3d-game.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
  # select the head and click next two times
  # click finish
  # Wait for the ceckout...

A new jave project named unical-3d-game will be loaded, here is our code!


=== Just for committers: ===

Ceckout https://unical-3d-game.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

It will ask you a username and a password, type in your googlecode ones.

Everytime you start your IDE, first ceck for updates: right click on the project and: project -> team -> update (to HEAD)

When you finished and you want to upload your changes just right click on your project and: project -> team -> commit, and type in a short description of your work.
